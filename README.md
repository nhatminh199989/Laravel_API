This is a basic CRUD API using laravel.

Firstly,I'm using laravel 7.24.0 so make sure you meet the requirement,then check if you are connected to your database. 
You can configure the database connection in the .env file.

Then follow these steps to run project:
<ol>
    <li>Run "php artisan serve"</li>
    <li>Run "php artisan migrate" </li>
    <li>Run "php artisan db:seed" - To generate some fake data</li>
</ol>  

Finaly, you can test the api using Postman.
